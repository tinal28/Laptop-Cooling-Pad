### Key Features

- **Automatic speed control** A thermistor sensor is used to measure the temperature of the laptop and according to the value read, fan speed is controlled.

- **PWM technique is used** speed of the fan is controlled using a PWM signal created using NE555 IC.
- **Better gaming experience** Included better low cost LED system in order to give a better gaming experience.

- **Proper ventilation** 3 fans are included to give a proper ventilation and a metel enclosure is also used to ensure a goog thermal conductance.
  
- **USB power in** Micro USB port is used to give 12V power in.
